								</header>
								<p>We're in San Francisco, with nothing to do in our spare time, so we follow the indie game scene quite closely.  We've struggled to find a website that presented in-depth, quality reviews so we decided to strike out and do it ourselves.  Our reviews are a candid unbiased view and revolve around one question, "Did we have fun playing it?".  Our reviews are chockful of handcrafted, high-quality gifs, so you can get a better feel for the game.  If you're interested in us reviewing your game, or have general feedback on the site, drop us a line at: indiesensereviews [at] gmail.com</p>
								<p>Outside of that I spend a lot of my time doing a bunch of SEO stuff. If you're in need of help, feel free to reach out. If you're looking for resources, I'd recommend this <a href="https://www.clickminded.com/seo-strategy/"> SEO strategy guide </a>. </p>
